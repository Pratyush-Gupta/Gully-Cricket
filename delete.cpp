    Real world problem :
    If ever you have travelled by government bus you would realize that often
    (Problems)
     (1) there is mess regarding seat capturing,
     (2) arguing about monetry fares ,
     (3) bus conductor has to make tickets of all pasengers, has to maintain count of all pasengers.
     (4) Government transport sector ( Uttar Pradesh Bus service ) ,has to appoint people to crosscheck the number of passengers present 
      in bus at various location between distination and source.

     1.Many times what happens if we are not present at bus stops ,buses generally do not stop to take us in
    (because most of the time they think that the person is a local passengers hardly he will travel 10km, which would occupy 
     seat for long distance passengers) .This is the reason why bus accumulation of at bus stops occur.Various bus conductor 
     do not leave for destination until they do not get sufficient passengers ( but they miss various passengers in between ).
     But if they would know that a passenger is present at particular location he can select so , to maximize the profit as
     well as passengers can board the bus (who just miss 
     because of not being at bus stop.)
     2.Generally at random bus stops  and ask the passengers where he would like to go ,(if he is a local passengers conductor )
      would surely refuse. We can save the fuel which is spent in stopping and starting the buses.
      Short distance passengers would also able to recognize the bus for themselves..
     
     Benefits:
     1.This would save time of passengers and maximize the profit.
     2.Would stop corruption if payment gateway is provided in the app.
     3.Bus accumulation would be stopped.
     4.Lots of fuel will saved.
     5.Buses would become more punctional.
     6.Buses would become active on passengers.
     7.Real time traking can help in traffic management.
     Features:
     web or app solution could have:
     1.For passengers: marking where want to board and destination:
     2.Conductor should be able to count of passengers ,thier location on map.
     3.Confirmatory button for passengers(that he will be getting the seat and we will allowed in bus).
